In automatic negotiation, intelligent agents simulate manual negotiation, and computer programs simulate real-world negotiation issues, processes, preferences, bids, gains and losses. The automatic negotiation between the agents of both parties is a complicated process. Both parties make complex bidding decisions based on the set strategy. In the same domain, different agent pairs establish opponent models according to different opponents, influence each other, and give different bidding decisions. The goal of the negotitation is to reach an agreement between the two parties and mamimize the benefits of both parties. In order to reach an agreement without both partites being exploited, the negotiation process must make full use of the computing power of the computer, and under certatin negotiation time and constraints, as much as possible to obtain negotiation information, predict the opponent's preference congiguration and decision-making strategy. Our agent established dynamic and compatible bid strategies and concession strategies based on the bid strategies and concession strategies of differnet opponents, in order to make profits. In the bidding process, as close as possible to the Pareto boundary of the bid. When our agent bids,try to chooose the same level of utility to ensure that it provides the highest utility to the opponent.
